# Infini-Pong - Bevy 0.13.2

This is a small project i built to learn some of Bevy.

While learning and creating my project I mostly used the following:
  - https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io
  - https://bevyengine.org/examples
  - https://github.com/CiderSlime/dungeon-quest
  - Bevy Discord - https://discord.com/invite/bevy

This is a very small project but structured as if it is a larger scale one, like dungeon-quest above.

Hopefully this is useful for your Bevy learning.
